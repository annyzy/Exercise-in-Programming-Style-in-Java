Exercises in Programming Style
==============================

This is the Week 3 exercise, the programs Eight.py/Nine.java/Ten.java run with the following command lineshell(~/cs253/week_3$)::


```bash
python Eight.py ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
```
Notice:

When it asks 'Select one to run (or press Ctrl-C to cancel):', you can just select the first one 'python39Full'.

It takes a litte while, please be patient!

```bash
java Nine ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
```
```bash
java Ten ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
```
